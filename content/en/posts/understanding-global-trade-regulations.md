- RCEP (Asia-Pacific)

## Compliance Requirements

### Customs Documentation
Accurate and complete documentation is crucial for smooth customs clearance:

2. **Work with Experts**: Partner with experienced customs brokers and trade consultants
3. **Implement Compliance Systems**: Use technology to track and manage compliance
